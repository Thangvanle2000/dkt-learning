<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<hr><p>When asked a question, you can make an <strong>affirmative sentence</strong><em> </em>by opening with ""yes,"" and a form of the verb ""to be.""</p>
<p><span><strong>Some examples:</strong></span></p>
<ol><li><span><strong>Question:</strong> ""Are you going to the party tonight?""<br><strong>Affirmative Sentence:</strong> ""Yes, I am.""</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Question:</strong> ""Will you be in class tomorrow?""<br><strong>Affirmative Sentence:</strong> ""Yes, I will.""</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Question: </strong>""Were you at the game last night?""<br><strong>Affirmative Sentence: </strong>""Yes, I was.""</span></li>
</ol><p><span>You can make informal affirmative sentences by simply using ""yes,"" or more informal forms of ""yes,"" such as, ""sure,"" ""yep,"" or ""absolutely.""<br><br><strong>Some examples:</strong></span></p>
<ol><li><span><strong>Question: </strong>""Are you going to the party tonight?""<br><strong>Affirmative Sentence: </strong>""Absolutely!""</span></li>

<li><span><strong>Question: </strong>""Were you at the game last night?""<br><strong>Affirmative Sentence: </strong>""Yes.""</span></li>
</ol><p><span>The opposite of an affirmative sentence<strong> </strong>is a<strong> negative sentence. </strong>You can make a negative sentence by starting with, ""no,"" and a form of the verb ""to be.""<br><br></span></p>

<p><strong><em>""I'm great! I just wanted to make sure you were in your office so I can stop by for the homework; I'm going on my big trip tomorrow!""</em></strong></p>
<p>To ""stop by"" is to visit someone for a short time. Zo wants to stop by his teacher's office-he wants to visit her for a short time so he can get the homework.</p>
<p>Here are more sentences that include the phrase, ""stop by.""</p>

<p>For Example:</p>

                            <p><strong><span> The Focus of This Lesson is Asking ""Who"" and ""Where"" and Answering Questions About Yourself.</span><br><span> ""So, who's the singer?""<br> ""Where are you from?""</span><br></strong></p>
<hr><p>In this lesson, we are going to cover a couple different ways to ask and answer questions in English. We'll begin with interrogative pronouns and move on to answering questions about yourself with negative and affirmative statements. Let's get started!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span> <strong> Asking Questions Using Interrogative Pronouns</strong></span></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<hr><p><em> Interrogative pronouns</em> are the words used to ask questions. Here are the most commonly used <em>interrogative pronouns</em>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who</strong> - Who did the action? <br><strong>What</strong> - What happened? <br><strong>When</strong> - When did it happen? At what time?<br><strong>Why</strong> - Why did it happen? What was the reason?<br><strong>Where</strong> - Where did it take place?<br><strong>How</strong> - How did it happen? How did it take place?<br><br> This group of <em>interrogative pronouns</em> is sometimes called, ""the five Ws (and one H)"" because they all begin with the letter W (and the letter H).</p>
<p>Using one of the ""five Ws"" is a great way to begin a conversation. Zo begins his conversation with Michelle by asking, ""So, <strong>who's</strong> the singer?""<br><br> After Michelle answers, Zo then asks, ""<strong>Where</strong> are you from?""<br><br> What else could Zo have asked Michelle? <br><br> Write five NEW questions using each of the ""five Ws (and one H)""</p>

<p>5.</p>
<p><span><strong>Answering Questions About Yourself Using Negative Statements and Affirmative Statements</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<hr><p><strong> Negative Statements</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our previous lesson, Zo asks Michelle, ""Are you a New Yorker?"" He wants to know if Michelle is from New York. Michelle answers with a <strong>negative statement;</strong> she says, ""No, I'm not,"" because she is not a New Yorker (a person from New York), but from Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of questions and <strong>negative</strong> answers or statements.</p>
<ol><li> ""Are you free to talk right now?""<strong><br>""No, I'm not.""</strong></li>
<li> ""Is that game fun to play?""<strong><br>""No, it's not.""</strong></li>
<li> ""Do those foods taste good?""<strong><br>""No, they do not.""</strong></li>
</ol><p>Create negative statements by starting with ""No,"" then the subject (""I,"" ""you,"" ""he,"" ""she,"" ""it,"" ""we,"" ""you,"" ""they""), then the verb, and finally the word, ""not.""</p>
<p>Like this<strong>:<br><br> No + I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they </strong>(subject)<strong> + am/are + not.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affirmative Statements</strong></p>
<p>Michelle asks Zo if he is from South Africa and Zo answers, ""Yes, I am!"" Zo uses an <strong>affirmative statement</strong> because he <em>is</em> from South Africa.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of questions and <strong>positive </strong>answers or statements.<em></em></p>
<ol><li> ""Are you free to talk right now?""<strong><br>""Yes, I am.""</strong></li>
<li>""Is that game fun to play?""<strong><br>""Yes, it is.""</strong></li>
<li> ""Do those foods taste good?""<strong><br>""Yes, they do.""</strong></li>
</ol><p>Create affirmative statements by starting with ""Yes,"" then the subject (""I,"" ""you,"" ""he,"" ""she,"" ""it,"" ""we,"" ""you,"" ""they""), then a form of the verb ""to be"" (""am, are, is""). <br><br> Like this:<br><br><strong>Yes + I/you/he/she/it/we/you/they </strong>(subject)<strong> + am/are/is.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Exercise</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Answer these questions using <strong>affirmative</strong> or <strong>negative</strong> statements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>Do you enjoy studying English?</li>
<li>Are you an American?</li>
<li>Do you study often?</li>
<li>Are you a good student?</li>
</ol>                        </div>
                                                                <h3>Cultural Insights</h3>

                            <p><span> <strong> More About Asking Where People are From!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>How does Michelle know where Zo is from before he tells her? She probably hears his accent and recognizes it as being from South Africa. Michelle tests her knowledge by asking Zo if he is in fact from (country). Zo seems excited that Michelle correctly identifies where he is from, even though she is wrong about the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While doing so is considered rude in some countries, it is not uncommon for Americans to ask foreign strangers where they are from. Usually it is a sign of genuine curiosity. As the years go by, America and other countries in the western world are becoming more and more diverse, and so is general interest in unfamiliar people and places. Granted, not everyone has good feelings about the world becoming more international, but if someone asks you where you're from, you can be fairly sure that they want to get to know you better, even if only for a short time.</p>                        </div>

                            <p><strong><span> The Focus of This Lesson is Asking, ""What Do You Do?"" and Talking About Jobs </span><br><span> ""So, what do you do in Los Angeles?"" <br> ""I'm a nutritionist and personal trainer."" </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>""What do you do?"" is probably one of the most commonly used phrases in the English language, particularly among those who have just met. In many English-speaking countries, especially America, talk about jobs and work can steer entire conversations. Luckily, asking someone what he does for a living is quite easy. You simply say, ""What do you do?""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Zo discovers that his new friend, Michelle, is from Los Angeles, he asks, ""So, <strong>what do you do</strong> in Los Angeles?""</p>
<p>Zo asks what Michelle does <em>in Los Angeles</em>, but adding the place name is not absolutely necessary. If Michelle had said she was from Detroit or Miami, Zo could have asked, ""What do you do in Detroit?"" or ""What do you do in Miami?"" Of course, he could have also just asked, ""What do you do?""</p>
<p>In the dialogue, Michelle responds, saying that she's ""a nutritionist and a personal trainer."" <br><br> Michelle explains that a nutritionist ""helps people eat healthy foods"" and that a personal trainer helps people ""exercise the right way.""</p>
<p>Of course, the list of professions is endless. Some examples of jobs are:</p>
<ol><li>""Firefighter""</li>
<li>""Hairstylist"" </li>
<li>""Musician""</li>
<li>""Art Director""</li>
<li>""Copywriter""</li>
<li>""Designer""</li>
<li>""Computer Engineer""</li>
</ol><p><strong>Try translating some of those professions into your native language. Have you ever had jobs like any of these?</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks what <em>you</em> do, answering is easy. Simply say, ""I'm a [name or description of job here].""</p>
<p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
<ol><li>""I'm a doctor.""</li>
<li>""I'm a bartender.""</li>
<li>""I work with children.""</li>
<li>""I teach.""</li>
<li>""I'm a professional wrestler.""</li>
<li>""I clean houses.""</li>
<li>""I'm a writer.""</li>
<li>""I sell wine.""</li>
</ol><p><strong>Have a friend ask you these questions and try to answer them as completely as possible, in English, of course:</strong></p>
<ol><li>What do you do? </li>
<li>Have you been doing it for a long time?</li>
<li>What's it like?</li>
<li>Do you enjoy it?</li>

</ol><p><strong>Talking About the Temperature</strong><br><br> In the dialogue, the temperature is ""fifty-three degrees Fahrenheit and about twelve degrees Celsius."" Usually, the temperature is given in EITHER degrees Fahrenheit (F) OR degrees Celsius (C). <br><br> Because Zo and Michelle are on a plane with passengers coming from different parts of the world, the pilot gives the temperature in BOTH scales. In most English-speaking countries, the temperature is reported in Fahrenheit.<br><br> The temperature can be used as an answer to the question, ""What's the weather like today?""</p>
<p><strong>For example:<br></strong><br><strong>Question:</strong> ""What's the weather like today?""<br><strong>Answer:</strong> ""Well, it'll be about fifty degrees in the morning, but it'll reach seventy-five degrees in the afternoon.""</p>

                            <p><span><strong>The Focus of This Lesson is </strong></span><span><strong>Possessive Adjectives used with</strong><strong> the Conjunction ""And,"" and t</strong></span><span><strong>he Demonstrative ""This,"" plus </strong></span><span><strong>Informal Imperatives.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>""This is my business card. This is my e-mail address and this is my phone number.</strong></span><span><strong> E-mail me!""</strong></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong> </strong></span></p>
<hr><p><strong> Possessive Adjectives</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Possessive adjectives are words that are used with nouns to show ownership. In the dialogue, Zo says to Michelle, ""This is <strong>my</strong> business card. This is <strong>my</strong> e-mail address and this is <strong>my</strong> phone number."" In this case, the possessive pronoun is ""my,"" which indicates that the nouns ""my"" <em>modifies</em> belong to the speaker; the business card, email address, and phone number all belong to Zo.<br><br>The other possesive pronouns are:</p>
<p><strong>My</strong>, <strong>your</strong>, <strong>his</strong>, <strong>her</strong>, <strong>its</strong>, <strong>our</strong>, and <strong>their</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>My</strong> business card = the business card belonging to <strong>me</strong><br><strong>Your </strong>business card = the business card belonging to <strong>you</strong><br><strong>His</strong> business card = the business card belonging to <strong>him</strong><br><strong>Her </strong>business card = the business card belonging to <strong>her</strong><br><strong>Its</strong> business card = the business card belonging to<strong> it</strong> (a dog, perhaps? or a cat?)<br><strong>Our</strong> business card = the business card belonging to <strong>us</strong><br><strong>Their</strong> business card = the business card belonging to <strong>them</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>The Conjunction ""And""</strong></span></p>
<hr><p>""And"" is a coordinating conjunction used to link two words, phrases, or clauses together.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><br></span><span>Demonstrative Pronoun ""This""</span></strong></p>
<hr><p>The demonstrative pronoun, ""this"" and the plural, ""these"" refer to nouns that are nearby in time or space. <br><br>In the dialogue, Zo says, ""By the way, <strong>This</strong> is my business card. <strong>This</strong> is my email address, and <strong>this</strong> is my phone number.""<br><br>He is showing his new friend Michelle his business card, which is nearby-- in his hand. On his business card are his email address and phone number. Often times a hand gesture like pointing is used with ""this"" and ""these"" to show just what it is the speaker is talking about.<br><br>We'll take a look at the other demonstrative pronouns in future lessons.<br><br><strong>Underline the possessive adjective and the demonstrative pronoun in each sentence:</strong></p>
<ol><li>This is my pen.</li>
<li>These are your shoes.</li>
<li>This is his book.</li>
<li>These are their papers.</li>
</ol><p><strong><span>Informal Imperatives</span></strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<hr><p><em> Informal imperatives </em>are casual commands you can give/say to a friend or anyone else you feel close to. Commands are sentences used to tell someone to do something. Some examples of <em>informal imperatives</em>, or casual commands, are:<br><br>""E-mail me."" <br>""Call me.""<br>""Write me.""<br><br>In the dialogue, Michelle says to Zo, ""E-mail me!"" She is reuqesting that he e-mail her and now that they're friends, she uses an informal imperative.<br><br>Informal imperatives are created by using the present tense of a verb and adding an objective pronoun. Like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-mail + me.<br>E-mail + him.<br>E-mail + her.<br>E-mail + us.<br>E-mail + them.<br><br>Call + me.<br>Call + him.<br>Call + her.<br>Call + us.<br>Cal + them.<br><br>Write + me.<br>Write + him.<br>Write + her.<br>Write + us<br>Write + them.</p>
<p>If you recall Lesson 2, you can make any of these <strong>informal imperatives</strong> into <strong>polite requests</strong> by adding ""please"":</p>
<p>Please mail me.<br>Please call me.<br>Please write me.</p>
<p>Create both polite and informal requests/imperatives for the following verbs:</p>
<p><strong>Tell</strong><br>Polite:<br>Informal:</p>
<p><strong>Take</strong><br>Polite:<br>Informal:</p>
<p><strong>Follow</strong><br>Polite:<br>Informal:</p>                        </div>

<hr><p>The most polite way to ask for someone's contact information—their phone number, email address, etc.—is to first offer your own. If the person is indeed interested in communicating with you further, her or she will offer his or her contact information in return. If the person does NOT offer their information in return, it is safe to assume that he or she is not interested in continuing a relationship with you. It's considered rude to demand that someone give you their personal information.</p>

                            <p><span><strong>The Focus of This Lesson is<span> </span></strong></span><span><strong>Implied Verbs</strong></span><span><strong><span> a</span>nd Prepositions</strong></span><br><span><strong><span>""Passport, please.""<br>""For two weeks."" <br>""At The L Hotel.""<br>""I'm here on business and to sight see.""</span></strong></span></p>
<hr><p><span><strong>Implied Verbs</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>The customs official opens the dialogue by saying to Zo, ""Passport please.""</p>
<p>What he means is, ""Give me your passport, please."" But he omits ""give"" and ""me"" and instead says, ""Passport, please.""<br><br>The verb, <em>to give</em>, is implied. Zo understands that the customs official would like see his passport. How does he understand? Well, the verb, to give, is implied or suggested. Any situation gives big clues as to what a conversation during that situation will be about.</p>
<p>Likewise, when the customs official asks Zo about the purpose of his stay—Zo's reason for visiting New York—Zo first responds by saying, ""Once again, please. Slowly, please.""</p>
<p>What Zo means is, ""Can you say that again? And can you say it slowly?""</p>
<p>Implied verbs are often used quick business transactions—when there isn't a lot of time for polite conversation, as in the interaction between Zo and the customs official.<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Prepositions</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Prepositions link nouns, pronouns and phrases to other words in a sentence. Prepositions are everywhere! It's awfully difficult to get on without them. So don't try to! A preposition shows the relationship of its object to the rest of the  sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sentences in the dialogue that use prepositions are (prepositions are underlined):<br><em><br><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><strong>For</strong></span><strong> two weeks.* = </strong></em>I'll stay in New York for two weeks.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">At</span> The L Hotel.* = </strong></em>I'm staying at The L Hotel.</p>
<p><em><strong>I'm here <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">on</span> business and <span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">to</span> sight see.</strong></em> = I'm here for the purpose of business and to do some sight seeing.</p>
<p>(*These sentences also include implied subjects and verbs for the reason mentioned above: both Zo and the customs official would like to keep their interaction as short as possible.)</p>
<p>Some of the most commonly used prepositions are</p>
<p>""about,"" ""above,"" ""across,"" ""after,"" ""along,"" ""among,"" ""around,"" ""at,"" ""before,"" ""behind,"" ""below,"" ""beneath,"" ""beside,"" ""between,"" ""beyond,"" ""but,"" ""by,"" ""despite,"" ""down,"" ""during,"" ""except,"" ""for,"" ""from,"" ""in,"" ""inside,"" ""into,"" ""like,"" ""near,"" ""of,"" ""off,"" ""on,"" ""onto,"" ""out,"" ""outside,"" ""over,"" ""past,"" ""through,"" ""throughout,"" ""to,"" ""toward,"" ""under,"" ""until,"" ""up,"" ""upon,"" ""with,"" ""within,"" and ""without.""</p>
<p><strong>Write five (5) sentences that each include one of the above prepositions.</strong></p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>I drink water <em>throughout</em> the day.<br>She ran <em>after</em> the bus.<br>The book is <em>under</em> your desk.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>You'll notice that the customs official is very short with Zo—that is to say, he or she doesn't provide long questions or answers. He or she simply wants to get the job done. He or she is not interested in friendly conversation, hence the absence of polite requests and small talk. The customs official is a man or woman of very few words; he or she is all about business, as we say. This seems to be true, however, of customs officials all over the world. Their job of keeping the airports—and countries, really—safe from intruders with bad intentions is a very serious one. If they were to be nice and polite and relaxed, it's likely that criminals would take advantage of them, and that the process of getting through customs would be much longer than it is. Customs officials have a high volume of visitors to process, as well as anxious visitors who simply want to move through the line quickly and easily so they can claim their baggage and be on their way. It's understandble that customs officials would want to do their jobs as efficiently and as quickly as possible. Which means very few words! And very little—if any—conversation!</p>                        </div>

<hr><p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><strong><br></strong></span><span><strong>The Infinitive, ""to go""</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>The <em>infinitive</em>, ""to go"" means to move, start, continue, pass. In the dialogue, the main character, Zo, tells the ticket seller, ""I'd like <strong>to go</strong> to Times Square."" Zo would like to move toward, to start for, to progress to Times Square. He is at the airport, but he'd like <strong>to go</strong> to Times Square.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""To go"" is the <em>infinitive</em> of the verb, ""go.""<br><br>An <em>infinitive</em> is created quite simply:</p>
<p>to + [simple form of a verb]</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p>To + sleep = to sleep<br>To + walk = to walk<br>To + run = to run<br>To + study = to study<br>To + read = to read<br><br>And in the dialogue,</p>
<p>to + go = to go</p>
<p><em>""I'd like <strong>to go</strong> to Times Square.</em>""<br><br>Infinitives can be used as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. And when they are, they become part of what is called an <em>infinitive phrase</em>.</p>
<p><em>""I'd like <strong>to go</strong> to Times Square.</em>""<br><br>...is an infinitive phrase in which the infinitive ""to go"" acts as a noun. <br><br><strong>Zo</strong> (subject) + <strong>would like</strong> (verb) + <strong>to go</strong> (infinitive) + <strong>to Times Square</strong> (direct object).</p>
<p>Take a look at these other sentences that use the infinitive, ""to go"":<br><br>""I want <strong>to go</strong> out.""</p>
<p>""I'd like to leave, but I don't know where <strong>to go</strong>.""<br><br>""Is it okay <strong>to go</strong> beyond the fence?""</p>
<p>""I don't want <strong>to go</strong> with you.""<br><br><strong>Create infinitive phrase with the infinitive forms of these verbs:</strong></p>

<p>win</p>

<p>ask</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Asking About Train or Bus Times</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>Asking about train or bus times is simple. In the dialogue, Zo asks the ticket seller, ""What time is the bus?""<br><br>In the dialogue, Zo says, ""I'd like to go to Times Square. What time is the bus?""<br><br>He says the name of the place he'd like to get to first, and then asks for the bus time.<br><br>The easiest way to ask for a train or bus time is to use the phrase:<br><strong><br><em>""What time is the train/bus to [location]?</em></strong>""<br><br>For example,<br><br>""What time is the bus to New Jersey?""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>EXERCISE</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Answer these questions about asking for a train or bus time:</strong><br><br>1. How would you ask when the train to Philadelphia is?</p>
<p>2. What about the bus to Boston?<br><br>3. Or the train to New Haven?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>The Conjunction, ""or""</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>The ticket seller asks Zo, ""Cash <strong>or</strong> credit card?""<br><br>""Or"" is a conjunction. You may remember from previous lessons that a conjunction is a word that links two words or phrases together. ""Or"" shows two choices or possibilities. For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Would you like tea or coffee?""</p>
<p>""Do you prefer to sit here or there?""</p>
<p>""Would you like to eat inside or outside?""</p>
<p><strong>Write sentences using the conjunction ""or"" for each of these pairs of words:</strong></p>
<p>EXAMPLE:<br><br>New York<br> Los Angeles<br><br>""Would you rather live in New York <strong>or</strong> Los Angeles?""</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>As you probably know, transportation options at airports are plentiful. There are trains, taxis, buses, private cars, and a few other ways to get from the airport to your accommodations—where you're staying. In the dialogue, Zo has landed at JFK International Airport in New York and will be traveling by <em>shuttle bus</em> to Times Square. Shuttle buses are so called because they ""shuttle,"" or transport, people quickly between two locations. While standard buses make many stops along a route, shuttle buses travel between two locations. Even though many feature extra room for luggage, airport shuttle buses are usually much smaller than standard buses. The most well-known airport shuttle bus company in America is Supershuttle, which serves air travelers across the country.</p>

<hr><p><span><strong>Counters</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>When Zo places the items he is buying on the counter in the store, the cashier takes stock—counts—all of Zo purchases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>""Okay—so that’s 3 bottles of water, 1 bottle of orange juice, 1 can of soda, a sandwich, a&nbsp; box of crackers, and a pack of gum.""</em></span></p>
<p>Counting nouns—especially foods—in English is, in a sense, quite easy. If you know the container that a food or drink is packaged in, or the shape a particular food is cooked or served in, you may already have an idea of how to count that food or drink. The list of counters, or ""counting words,"" is nearly endless, as are the counters that you use for any given object. <br><br><strong>Take a look at the first three counters that appear in the dialogue:</strong><br><br><em>3 bottles of water<br>1 bottle of orange juice<br>I can of soda</em><br><br>Zo is buying water that has been packaged in bottles. The orange juice has been packaged into a bottle, too. He is also buying a can of soda—the soda has been packaged into a can.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other ways to package water, juice, and soda:</p>
<p>water in three (3) jugs = 3 jugs of water<br>orange juice in two (2) cartons = 2 cartons of orange juice<br>soda in a one (1) bottle = a bottle of soda<br><br>As you can see, <strong>the counter, or ""counting word,"" you use for an object depends on how that object is packaged.</strong><br><br>*Note: the number one (1) can always be signified with the particle ""a"": <em><strong>a</strong> can of soda, <strong>a</strong> bottle of water, <strong>a</strong> carton of orange juice.</em></p>
<p>Zo also buys:<br><br><em>a sandwich<br>a <strong>box</strong> of crackers<br>a <strong>pack</strong> of gum<br><br>A sandwich = </em>one sandwich; sandwiches typically don't require counters<br><em>A box of crackers = </em>one box of crackers<em><br>A pack of gum = </em>one pack (chewing gum packaging) of gum<br><br>Here are some more counters used for foods and drinks:<br><br><em>Five <strong>slices</strong> of pizza<br><br>Three <strong>glasses </strong>of wine<br><br>One <strong>plate</strong> of vegetables<br><br>Six <strong>cups</strong> of tea<br><br>A <strong>stick</strong> of gum<br><br>Three apple <strong>wedges</strong> (small, triangle-shaped pieces)</em><br><br>The list goes on and on! What other counters can you think of?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>""What Is That?</strong><strong>""</strong></span><span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><strong><br></strong></span></p>
<hr><p>Zo sees a strange food behind the counter in the convenience store. He doesn't know what it is, so he asks the cashier:</p>
<p><span><em>""What is <strong>that</strong>?""</em></span><span><br></span></p>
<p><strong><em>That </em></strong>is a <em>demonstrative.</em></p>
<p><em>Demonstratives </em>are adjectives and pronouns that identify which object or person the person speaking about. In this case, <em>that</em> is a <em>demonsrative pronoun</em>.</p>
<p>Demonstratives agree in number (singular or plural) with the objects or people being identified and change depending on how far they are from the speaker.</p>
<p><em>""What is that?""</em> = ""What is that thing (singular) <em>over there</em>?""<br><br>The table below illustrates the proper demonstrative pronoun to use depending on 1) whether the thing it refers to is singular or plural, and 2) whether the thing is near to or far from the speaker:<br><br></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>It's probably safe to say that there are convenience stores in every heavily populated corner of the world. But also that every country and every city has its own brand of convenience stores. In New York, there are two main types of convenience stores: chains—or a series of stores owned by one big company—and independently owned, smaller stores and street stalls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the chain stores (or ""chains""), because they're owned and operated by a big corporation, have the largest and broadest selection of products. From sewing kits and gift wrap to magazines and cold medicine, chain convenience stores have just about anything you might need for any given situation. Smaller, independently-owned convenience stores—sometimes called ""corner stores,"" because of their common location at or near street corners—and street stalls (sometimes called <em>bodegas</em>) take up far less space and so have fewer items to choose from, most of which are foods and snacks, and important household items like toilet paper, paper towels, and toothpaste. These smaller operations often sell sandwiches and other prepared foods, and are often open until the late hours of the night.</p>
<p>At one time, chains kept regular business hours and closed in the evening; these days, to compete with the smaller convenience stores and street stalls, which are open quite late, more and more chains stay open either late into the evening, or for 24 hours.</p>                        </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Zo is confirming his reservation with the front desk worker he wants to know if he can access the Internet from the confines of the room he'll be staying in. He makes an <em>interrogative sentence</em> and says, ""Is there Internet in the room?""<em> </em>Zo also inquires if there are toiletries (toothpaste, soap, shampoo): ""Are there toiletries?""<br><em><br>Interrogative sentences</em> are questions. <span>Basic statements can be made into questions very simply; just </span><span>place the verb before the word<span> ""</span><span>there.</span><span>"" Here are some examples:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>""There <strong>is</strong> Internet in the room."" = ""<strong>Is</strong> there Internet in the room?""<br>""There <strong>are</strong> toiletries."" = <strong>""Are</strong> there toiletries?""</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Change these declarative sentences into interrogative sentences, or questions:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. There are six people at the table. = _________________________________________________?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. There is a book on the floor. = </span></span><span><span>_________________________________________________?</span></span><br><span><span> <br> 3.

Are there people in the audience? =</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>_________________________________________________.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>As you can see, you should use ""is there?"" with SINGULAR nouns, and ""are there?"" with PLURAL nouns<span>:</span></strong></p>
<p>""Is there&nbsp; + (singular noun)?""</p>
<p><span>""Are there + (plural noun)?""</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Fill in these sentences with <em>Is there</em>... or <em>Are there</em>...:</strong></span></p>

<p><span>5. </span><span>_____________________ a pen I can use?</span><br><span><br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Prepositions</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>We've addressed prepositions in previous lessons, but you can never review them too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you recall, prepositions words that <em></em> link nouns, pronouns and phrases to other words in a sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Here are sentences from the dialogue that include propositions:</strong></p>
<p><em>""Welcome <strong>to</strong> The L Hotel!""</em><em><br>""Is there Internet <strong>in</strong> the room?""<strong><br>""From</strong> 6:00 A.M. <strong>to</strong> 7:30 A.M. <strong>on</strong> the first floor <strong>in</strong> the dining room.""</em></p>
<p>Complete each of the following sentences with an appropriate preposition:<br><br>""There are some books _______ the table.""<br><br>""I'd like to give these things _______ my sister.""<br><br>""I'm going to the concert _______ a friend.""<br><br>Create three (3) of your own sentences using prepositions:</p>

<p>Of course, New York has every sort of hotel you can imagine: major, luxury hotels like the Ritz-Carlton or the Waldorf-Astoria, design and boutique hotels like the Gramercy Park Hotel or The W Hotel, youth hostels, and even the YMCA. One can pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for an incredibly stylish, perfectly located hotel where no detail is left unattended and your every desire is met with a smile by a gracious, attentive staff, or you can pay under US$50 for bed in a hostel room you share with other young travelers on tight budgets. At any rate, the possibilities are endless. As with everything else in New York, there's something for everyone!</p>                        </div>

</strong></p>
<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the future simple tense</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the infinitive form of a verb</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer questions in a formal situation</strong></li>
</ol><p><strong>
<span>1. Using the Future Simple Tense</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use the future simple tense to explain what we will do in the future. When we use ""will,"" it is either as a prediction of the future or simple statement of what will happen. We can also say what won't happen in the future.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""148"" class=""lsn3-th"">

<p>wil study</p>

<td width=""148"">

</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I will eat breakfast.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I won't eat breakfast.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I will sing at karaoke.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I won't sing at karaoke.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>2. Using the Infinitive Form of a Verb</span>
</strong></p>
<p>The infinitive form of a verb is a verb with the word ""to"" in front of it. The verb that follows ""to"" is in its base form, also known as its dictionary form. We can use infinitive verbs as the subject of a sentence and to follow other verbs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I like to play soccer.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""It is hard to speak English.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I need to speak to you.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I promise to write this report.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>3. Answering Questions in a Formal Situation </span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When answering questions in a formal situation, we try to be as polite as possible. That usually means using a lot of words. In informal situations, we can drop words and shorten sentences.</p>
<p>For example, the border officer asks Katrina where she will live and Katrina answers ""I will live in London.""</p>
<p>She could have answered ""I'll live in London,"" or even simply ""London,"" and it would have answered the question. However, both sentences are more informal than the answer she gave, and aren't suitable as formal answers.</p>
<p>Another example is her answer ""I am here to study."" She could have answered ""I'm studying here,"" or even ""To study,"" but they wouldn't be good answers to a formal question.</p>
<p>If you asked a question in formal English, always try to reply in formal English.</p>
<p>Here are a few common words and phrases that are used in formal English, compared to informal English.</p>

                            <p><strong><span>Formality in English</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although English doesn't have the strict rules of some other languages, it still has formal and informal ways of speaking. Formal English isn't as distinctly different from informal English as other languages either, but there is a difference. Speaking informally when formal language is expected won't impress the people you are talking to. If you're able to switch between formal and informal language depending on the situation, your English will sound more natural and fluent than if you can't. When you're in a formal situation, it's always best to use a full sentence instead of just one- or two-word answers, and to not use any slang or colloquialisms you may have picked up from English TV programmes or friends. If you're talking to strangers, people in authority, or are in a situation such as a job interview, always speak formally. But, if the situation becomes more relaxed and they speak informally to you, then you can speak informally as well. If in doubt though, stick to formal language.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The easiest way to form an interrogative sentence is to start with a question word that is often followed by an auxiliary verb. The object of the question usually comes later in the sentence, after the verb or in the middle of a verb phrase.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For example:</p>
<ol><li>""What did you watch last night?""</li>
</ol><p dir=""ltr"">The sentence starts with the question word ""what,"" so we immediately know that it is a question. This is also the object.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Next is the auxiliary verb ""did,"" which is the past tense of ""do.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is followed by ""you,"" to show who is being asked the question.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Next is the verb ""watch.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The last words are the time adverb, ""last night.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And finally, there is a question mark to confirm again that it is a question.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Another example:</p>
<ol><li>""When did you clean your room?""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The sentence starts with the question word ""when,"" so we immediately know that it's a question.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Next is the auxiliary verb ""did,"" which is the past tense of ""do.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is followed by ""you,"" to show who is being asked the question.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Next is the verb ""clean.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The last words are the object of the sentence ""your room.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And finally, there is a question mark to confirm again that it is a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The basic pattern for these questions is..</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">[question word] + [auxiliary verb] + [verb] + [object] + [question mark]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The verb is in its infinitive form, but has no ""to"" attached.</p>

<p><strong><span>3. Giving the Right Intonation While Asking a Question</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asking a question, it is important to get the intonation right. Usually, we finish an interrogative sentence by raising our pitch, as this makes it sound like the speaker doesn't know the answer and is asking a question.</p>
<p>Sometimes, during a conversation where the question is getting more information about the topic already being discussed, the pitch will fall instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""How much is the rent?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Does the flat have a garden?""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the UK, you will find many housing estates where many similar houses are grouped together. Popular housing types include terraced, where houses are attached in a row, semi-detached, where houses only have one house attached to them, and detached, where houses have no houses attached next door. Generally, people buy their own houses in the UK, although renting houses is popular in big cities or with younger people who can't afford to buy a house. Space is limited in the UK, so houses are small and very expensive compared to other countries. Blocks of flats are common sights in inner cities as they make the most of the limited space on offer. Most houses though have a garden. These are usually at the back of the house and are usually very green, with lots of grass and plant life. Some houses have small gardens at the front too, and a popular weekend pastime for people in the UK is to tidy up the garden.</p>

<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;Use adjectives to describe what is needed</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Use numbers to indicate the required quantity</strong></li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>1. Use Adjectives to Describe What is Needed</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An adjective is a word that is used to describe or modify a noun or pronoun. We use the adjective before the item that is being described—<em>small</em> bag, <em>yellow</em> car, <em>round</em> table.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common adjectives.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""199"">
<p>small</p>
</td>
<td width=""193"">
<p>beautiful</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""199"">
<p>medium</p>
</td>
<td width=""193"">
<p>loud</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""199"">
<p>large</p>
</td>
<td width=""193"">
<p>quiet</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""199"">
<p>fast</p>
</td>
<td width=""193"">
<p>boring</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""199"">
<p>slow</p>
</td>
<td width=""193"">
<p>fun</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colours can also be used as adjectives: for example, <em>blue</em> book, <em>black</em> cat.</p>
<p>In a full sentence, the adjective fits in before the noun and nothing else needs to be changed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I like apples.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I like <em>green </em>apples.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I have a house.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I have a <em>big </em>house.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>2. Use Numbers to Indicate the Required Quantity </span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also use numbers to describe items and this is frequently used when talking about how much we have, or how much we want.</p>
<p>Again, the number goes in front of the item: ""<em>three</em> bags,"" ""<em>five</em> cars,"" ""<em>twelve</em> tables."" Be careful and make sure to add an ""s"" to countable nouns if it is more than one!</p>
<p>We can also use more general adjectives to describe quantities if we don't want to use specific numbers or can't use specific numbers.</p>
<p>Here are some common adjectives used for quantities.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>a lot of</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>the most</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>many</p>

<p>little</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>the least</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, these are placed in front of the noun:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I have a few cars.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I have many bags.""</li>
</ol><p>There are also some specific words used to describe quantities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK used to have many small grocery shops throughout the country where people did their weekly shopping, but these have become less popular as more large supermarkets have opened. The supermarkets use their size and buying power to sell goods more cheaply. There are four big supermarket chains that own the majority of the market: Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury's, and Morrisons. Some supermarkets are in easy-to-reach locations in the centre of towns and villages, but some of the bigger supermarkets are on the outskirts and need a car or bus ride to reach. British people usually shop big, and often buy enough food to last a week or two at a time. Meat and vegetables are popular foods to buy for people who cook at home, as most traditional British food is based around them. Other foods such as rice and pasta are eaten, but are less popular than in other countries. Most supermarkets also do a wide range of frozen meals that are quick and easy to prepare by simply microwaving them. These 'ready meals' are becoming increasingly popular.</p>

<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;Use positional and directional words</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Form imperative sentences/give simple commands</strong></li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<hr><p><strong><span>1. Using Positional and Directional Words</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most useful words when giving directions are prepositions of place. The most commonly used ones are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>next to</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>adjacent to</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>by</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>near to,   next to</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>across from</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>on the   other side</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>behind</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>at the back   of</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>in front of</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>before</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use these prepositions in front of the building or place that we are using as a reference.</p>
<p>For example, if we are giving directions to the bank:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The bank is next to the park.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The bank is by the post office.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The bank is across from the school.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The bank is behind the library.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The bank is in front of the supermarket.""</li>
</ol><p>We can also use adverbs of place to help give directions. Some common ones are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>outside</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>not inside,   the exterior</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>nearby</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>close, in   the vicinity</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>around</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>in the   vicinity of, in all directions</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>inside</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>within, the   interior</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use also use adverbs of place as prepositions. In these sentences, a noun isn't always needed and we can make a sentence just with the subject and adverb.</p>
<p>For example, if we are looking for Mark:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is outside.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is nearby.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is around.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is inside.""</li>
</ol><p>If we do use a noun, then again the adverb goes before the noun.</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is outside the train station.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is nearby the school.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is around the park.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Mark is inside the bakery.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>2. Forming Imperative Sentences/Giving Simple Commands</span></strong></p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An imperative sentence is a sentence that gives a direct command. Often, imperative sentences have no subject and are formed from the base form of a verb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""98"" class=""lsn3-th"">
<p><span><strong>Infinitive Form</strong></span></p>
</td>
<td width=""98"" class=""lsn3-th"">
<p><span><strong>Imperative Form</strong></span></p>
</td>
<td width=""98"" class=""lsn3-th"">
<p><span><strong>Example</strong></span></p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""98"">
<p>to shut</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>shut</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>Shut the   door!</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""98"">
<p>to pass</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>pass</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>Pass the   salt.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""98"">
<p>to go</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>go</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>Let's go!</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""98"">
<p>to be</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>be</p>
</td>
<td width=""98"">
<p>Be there at   3pm.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make a negative imperative sentence, just add ""do not/don't"" before the imperative form.</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Do not shut the door!""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Do not pass the salt.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Don't go!""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Do not be there at 3 p.m.""</li>
</ol><p><br> If you want to make the command more forceful in writing, then you can add an exclamation mark to the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>The imperative form is often used in instructions, as they need to be short and tell people what to do. It is also often used when giving directions, as again you are telling people what to do.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>A: ""Excuse me, do you know where a post office is?""<br>B: ""Sure, go straight down this street until you see the lights. Make a right onto the main street and walk straight down toward the park. It's past the library on the left side.""</li>
</ol><p>When giving directions, you can also use your hands and point in the right direction to help. If you ask somebody, try repeating the directions the person says so that you know for sure that you understand. If somebody asks you, you might have to repeat the directions to clarify.</p>
<p>But be careful—if you are asking somebody to do something for you, then don't use an imperative sentence as it can be seen as rude in that case!</p>
<p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If you turn right at the traffic lights, my flat is on that road.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The lights next to the pub.""</li>

<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving directions in the UK isn't the easiest thing to do. Cities and towns are not neatly laid out in blocks, but have roads that twist and turn and go in all directions. For longer distances there are many convenient and well looked-after motorways and major roads, but navigating around cities can be tricky. Although road names are usually well signposted and easy to spot, most people in the UK give directions using landmarks, such as shops or pubs, or use traffic lights and islands. There are usually several different ways to get somewhere and the shortest route isn't always the quickest as it depends on traffic and the time of day. There are many ways to give directions and it is very easy to get lost. Sat navs have become very popular in recent years!</p>

<p>
</p><hr><p>In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;Use adverbs of frequency and prepositions of time</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Form the present simple tense</strong></li>
</ol><p>
</p><hr><p><strong><span>1. Using Adverbs of Frequency and Prepositions of Time</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adverbs of Frequency</strong></p>
<p>You already know that adverbs modify, or describe, verbs. Adverbs can also express the frequency with which something is done—how often something is done. Adverbs of frequency are used just like any other adverbs—they're placed just before the main verbs they refer to.</p>
<p>Here are the most common verbs of frequency. They are listed from the most frequent, to the least frequent.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>always</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>I always   listen to music before bed.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>usually</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>I usually   eat bread for breakfast.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>often</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>I often   sleep late.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>sometimes</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>I sometimes   miss my train.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>occasionally</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>I   occasionally cry at movies.</p>
</td>
</tr><tr><td width=""148"">
<p>rarely</p>
</td>
<td width=""148"">
<p>I rarely   get lost.</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When adverbs of frequency modify the verb, ""to be,"" they are placed AFTER the verb. For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I am always tired.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""They are never late.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She is frequently angry.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adjectives of Frequency</strong></p>
<p>We can also use adjectives, such as ""every"" and ""some,"" to describe our schedule.</p>
<p>Katrina says in the dialogue ""I have two classes every morning one every afternoon."" Another example would be ""I watch TV some evenings."" In this case, the adjectives are placed <em>after</em> the verb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prepositions </strong></p>
<p>Prepositions link nouns, pronouns, and phrases to other words in a sentence. Prepositions are everywhere! It's awfully difficult to get on without them. So don't try to! A preposition shows the relationship of its object to the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>The sentences in the dialogue that use prepositions are:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""My classes start <em>on </em>Monday in the main lecture hall.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""They start at 9:30 <em>in </em>the morning.""</li>
</ol><p>When using prepositions with time, they go before the time they are talking about. Using phrases such as ""on [day]"" or ""in [the morning/afternoon/evening],"" ""at [4 p.m./specific time] are very common ways to explain time. Make sure you get the right preposition!</p>

<p><strong><span>2. Forming the Present Simple Tense</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use the present simple tense to talk about something that is happening in the present. Making a sentence in the present simple tense is easy to do and follows a simple formula.</p>
<p>[subject] + [base verb] + [object]</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I eat apples.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I want a bike.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I study English.""</li>
</ol><p>If we are talking about a third person and the subject is ""he"" or ""she,"" we must add an 's' to the verb.</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He eats apples.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She wants a bike.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He studies English."" [""study"" is an irregular verb, so the form is ""studies""]</li>

<p>Using the present simple tense and adverbs and adjectives of time, it is easy to talk about our daily schedule.</p>
<p>Let's give it a try!</p>
<p>""Every day I wake up at seven in the morning. I always eat cereal for breakfast and go to school at 8 a.m. I usually drive my car to work, but occasionally I take the bus. My work starts at 9 a.m. and I am never late. At 12 p.m. I eat lunch and sometimes talk with my colleagues about work. Every week we hold a meeting and speak about our performance. At 5 p.m. I go home.""</p>

                            <p><strong><span>School in the UK</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although education in the UK varies slightly from country to country, children have to be in full-time education from the ages of 5 to 16. From the ages of 5 to 11, they attend primary school and then spend five years at secondary school. Many children decide to have further education from the ages of 16 to 18, but this is their choice. Usually, school is Monday to Friday and runs from around 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. There are after-school activities and clubs, but they are not compulsory. Unlike other countries, students do not graduate from secondary school. Instead, students sit several exams, called GCSEs, and get a mark for each subject. There are also national exams at the age of 11 and other exams created by the teachers in other years.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK's climate is pretty mild as winter temperatures are cool, but not freezing, and summer temperatures warm without being boiling hot. Snow does fall across the UK and can occasionally be heavy, but throughout most of England and Wales it isn't severe. The UK has very unsettled weather, and can experience cloud, sun, and rain within the space of a few hours. If you go to the UK, always have an umbrella with you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the weather is so changeable, it is a very popular topic of conversation. British people like to talk about the weather and complain about the heat, cold, or rain. There are many weather idioms that people like to use, such as ""raining cats and dogs"" or ""the heavens opened"" to describe heavy rain. People also use weather words to describe other situations, such as ""storm in a teacup"" for a situation that isn't serious or ""face like thunder"" to describe someone who is angry.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;Use modal verbs to ask for and give suggestions</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Use conditionals - ""If clauses""</strong></li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>
<span>1. Using Modal Verbs To Ask For and Give Suggestions</span></strong></p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A modal verb is an auxiliary verb that describes modality—the potential of something happening, the ability for it to happen, and whether there is permission for it to happen.</p>
<p>An example from the dialogue is when Katrina says ""You should have a party.""</p>
<p><strong><span>Modal + Various Verb Forms</span>
</strong></p>
<p>Modal verbs are generally followed by the base form of the verb.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She should come with us to the party.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""They must finish their homework before dinner.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I might play tennis after work.""</li>
</ol><p>Usually, modal verbs' grammar dictates that modal verbs are followed by the base form of the verb to the present or future moment. However, modal verbs can also be used with other forms of verbs. The most common of these modal verbs' grammar forms is the use of the modal plus a perfect form to refer to a past time when using a modal verb of probability.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She must have bought that house.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Jane could have thought he was late.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Tim can't have believed her story.""</li>
</ol><p>Other forms used include the modal plus the progressive form to refer to what may/should/could be happening at the present moment of time.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He may be studying for his math exam.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He must be thinking about the future.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Tom can be driving that truck, he's sick today.""</li>
</ol><p>Here are some examples of modal verbs in action.</p>

<p><strong><span>2. Using Conditionals—""If clauses"" </span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A conditional sentence is a sentence that says that something will happen, but only if a condition is fulfilled. An example from the dialogue is ""The new Chinese restaurant has discounts if you go on Thursdays."" These sentences use the conjunction ""if.""</p>
<p>There are three types of conditional ""if"" sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Type 1</strong>: it is possible and very likely that the condition will happen</p>
<p>We make these sentences using [if] + [simple present] + [will verb]</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If I wake up early, I'll go to the gym.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If he asks me, I'll help him.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If you read this book, you will enjoy it.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type 2</strong>: it is possible but unlikely that the condition will happen.</p>
<p>We make these sentences using [if] + [simple past] + [would infinitive]</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If I woke up early, I would go to the gym.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If he asked me, I would help him.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If you read this book, you would enjoy it.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type 3</strong>: it is impossible for the condition to occur because it is in the past.</p>
<p>We make these sentences using [if] + [past perfect] + [would, have, past participle]</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If I had woke up early, I would have gone to the gym.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If he had asked me, I would have helped him.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""If you had read this book, you would have enjoyed it.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""What do you think I should do?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""How about going to a restaurant?""</li>

</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons to celebrate in the UK. The most popular reasons for parties and celebrations are birthdays and weddings. Important birthdays, such as 18 and any year after 20 that ends in 0 are especially celebrated. People may also have celebrations for landmark wedding anniversaries such as 25 or 50. You might get invited to smaller celebrations too, such as for a pregnancy, leaving a job, retiring, or moving house. Large parties are usually held at a special place such as a hotel, event room at a pub, or a church or public hall. Small celebrations can be held at home or at a restaurant. For bigger parties such as weddings and birthdays you might receive a paper invitation. This will have the details of the party, including location and time. It is polite to send a reply saying if you will go or not. For smaller celebrations, you might just get asked during a conversation.</p>                        </div>

<p>
</p><hr><p>In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Use modal verbs to ask for permission</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use the conjunction ""as""</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use imperative form to give reminders and recommendations</strong></li>
</ol><p>
</p><hr><p><strong><span>1. Using Modal Verbs to Ask for Permission</span>
</strong></p>
<p>In lesson 7, we introduced modal verbs and spoke about their many uses. One of those uses was to give or ask for permission, and in this lesson we will concentrate on that use.</p>
<p>The modal verbs used for permission are ""can,"" ""could"" and ""may.""</p>
<p>""can""</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can I park here?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can I go home?""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""could"" - this is more formal and polite than <em>can</em></p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Could I borrow your pen?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Could I study with you?""</li>
</ol><p>""may"" - this is even more formal and polite</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""May I take your photo?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""May I shake your hand?""</li>
</ol><p>With each word, the sentence structure is:</p>
<p><strong>[modal verb] + [I] + [base verb] + [object/complement]</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>2. Using the Conjunction ""as"" </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><hr><p>A conjunction is a word that connects words, clauses, or sentences. There are two types of conjunctions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coordinating Conjunctions</strong></p>
<p>There are seven coordinating conjunctions-""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" ""nor,"" ""for,"" ""yet,"" ""so."" They are all short words so they are easy to remember! They are used to connect words and clauses of equal importance. The most common of these are ""and,"" ""but,"" and&nbsp; ""or.""</p>
<p><strong>Subordinating Conjunctions</strong></p>
<p>There are many subordinating conjunctions:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td width=""140"">
<p>after</p>
<p>although</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>as if</p>
<p>as long as</p>

<p>because</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>even if</p>
<p>even though</p>
</td>
<td width=""144"">
<p>if</p>
<p>if only</p>
<p>in order that</p>
<p>now that</p>
<p>once</p>
<p>rather than</p>
<p>since</p>
<p>so that</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>that</p>
</td>
<td width=""140"">
<p>though</p>
<p>till</p>
<p>unless</p>
<p>until</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>whenever</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>whereas</p>
<p>wherever</p>
<p>while</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are used to link subordinate clauses to main clauses. The conjunction ""as"" is a subordinate clause. We use it to give a reason so it is very similar to ""because.""</p>
<p>In the dialogue, Phil says ""I really need it back by 3:30pm as I have to go to school.""</p>
<p>He means that because he has school and will use his bike to go there, Katrina needs to return it by 3:30. He uses ""as"" to connect the subordinate clause ""I have to go to school.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sentence formation is:</p>
<p><strong>[main clause] + [as] + [subordinate clause]</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I was late for work as I overslept.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I don't want the soup as I don't like onion.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He didn't watch the football game as he doesn't have a TV.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>3. Using the Imperative Form to Give Reminders and Recommendations</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In lesson 4 we spoke about the imperative form. This is used to give direct commands, such as ""shut the door"" and ""be quiet.""</p>
<p>We can also use the imperative form to give reminders and recommendations.</p>
<p>Some common phrases are:</p>
<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Don't forget"": ""Don't forget your umbrella.""; ""Don't forget to brush your teeth.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Don't be"": ""Don't be late!""; ""Don't get lost!""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Keep"": ""Keep calm.""; ""Keep your bag closed.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Always""; ""Always smile.""; ""Always work hard.""</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example from the dialogue:</strong></p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can I borrow your bike?""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

</strong></p>
<p>Bikes aren't as popular a mode of transport in the UK compared to other countries. The UK is lacking in bike paths and many roads are busy and congested, so it is dangerous to ride a bike. The UK also has many hills, so it can be difficult to ride a bike too far! There aren't many places to safely park a bike either. Most people prefer to drive a car or use public transport, such as buses and trains, to get to their destination. For those that do ride a bike, there are many laws. Bikes should be ridden on the road, not on the pavement, and it is the law for cyclists to wear helmets. These laws and the extra energy and time needed to cycle are a great deterrent for many people.</p>

</p><hr><p><span><strong>1. Using Modal Verbs to Talk About our Abilities</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><hr><p>We have spoken about modal verbs in previous lessons and focused on using them to give permission in lesson 8. In this lesson we will look at another use for them-to talk about ability.</p>
<p>We can use the modal verb ""can"" to express ability. Another form that can be used to express ability is ""to be able to."" Usually, either of these two forms can be used.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I <em>can </em>play the piano."" = I<em>'m able to</em> play the piano.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She <em>can </em>speak Spanish."" = She<em>'s able to</em> speak Spanish.</li>
</ol><p>There is no future or perfect form of ""can."" We can use 'to be able to' in both future and perfect tenses.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Jack<em>'s been able to</em> play golf for three years.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I<em>'ll be able to</em> speak Spanish when I finish the course.""</li>
</ol><p>The verbs ""can"" and ""to be able"" have the same meaning; both are used to express an ability or possibility.</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I can sing"" = I am able to sing</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I can dance"" = I am able to dance</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I can write"" = I am able to write</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I can"" = I am able</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You can"" = You are able</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He or she can"" = He or she is able</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""We can"" = We are able</li>

<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She <em>can </em>speak Spanish."" - She <em>can't </em>speak Spanish.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She<em>'s</em> <em>able to</em> speak Spanish."" - She <em>isn't able to</em> speak Spanish.</li>
</ol><p>Although both ""can't"" and ""not able to"" mean the same thing and are interchangeable, using ""can't"" is more common and popular.</p>
<p>We can also ask and answer simple questions using these words. Again, although ""be able to"" is fine to use, ""can"" is more popular.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can you write in Chinese?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can you sing well?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can you fall asleep easily?""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Can you do difficult mathematics?""</li>
</ol><p>We can answer all of these questions with either ""Yes, I can"" or ""No, I can't.""</p>
<p>In the lesson, both Katrina and Phil talk about what they can and can't do.</p>
<p>Katrina: ""Oh, I can't play squash.""</p>
<p>Phil: ""Ah, I can't swim!""</p>
<p>I wonder what sport they both <em>can</em> do?</p>

<p><strong><span>2. Using Frequency Adverbs</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adverbs of frequency are words that explain how often something happens.</p>
<p>There are two types of frequency adverbs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adverbs of Definite Frequency</strong></p>
<p>These are adverbs that are a definite time period. Examples are daily, weekly, hourly, monthly, once, twice, every year, every day etc.</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I eat breakfast <em>every morning</em>.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The weather report updates <em>hourly</em>.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He called me <em>once.""</em></li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adverbs of Indefinite Frequency</strong></p>
<p>These are adverbs that aren't a definite time period.</p>
<p>Some common adverbs, in order of frequency, are...</p>

<p><strong><span>3. Using Question Tags </span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tag questions are a structure in which a declarative statement or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment. We call these fragments a ""tag.""</p>
<p>[Declarative statement] + [tag] = tag question</p>
<p>""You can still try + right"" = ""You can still try, right?""</p>
<p>Tag questions are used to confirm information, and to check information.</p>
<p>Tag questions are more prevalent in spoken than in written English. They can be used to express a variety of emotions, such as politeness or lack of confidence, while others are used to express anger or suspicion. Tag questions are also often used to show emphasis. So, there are several ways to ""tag"" questions.</p>
<p>Politeness:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""We can go to the park tomorrow, can't we?""</li>
</ol><p>Lack of confidence:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The answer to the puzzle is number one, isn't it?""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anger:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You missed the train again, right?!""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspicion:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You wrote this report on your own, didn't you?""</li>
</ol><p>For some tag questions, such as those used to express anger and suspicion, tone of voice is also quite important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Examples from the dialogue:</strong></p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm really bad at it. I always miss the ball.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm good at swimming.""</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><hr><p>Joining a gym is becoming increasingly popular in the UK, especially with young adults and professionals. Most cities and large towns have several gyms for people to choose from and they often open 24 hours a day. Gyms are a great place to do your own exercise or to enrol in classes or have training programs planned for you. As well as gyms, some people like to go walking or running and many pubs and social clubs have sports teams. Football is especially popular with pubs, and many people spend their weekends playing football games in amateur leagues. There is also a big diet culture in the UK and there are many specialist diet foods that can be bought both in regular supermarkets and also health food stores. These health stores can also be found in most cities and shopping centres.</p>

<p><strong><span>The Focus of This Lesson is Accepting or Rejecting an Invitation in a Polite Manner <br></span>""</strong><strong>Thanks for the kind invite! I'd love to come!""</strong></p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In this lesson, we will learn how to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Form the present continuous tense (with the verb: having)</strong></li>
</ol><strong> </strong>
<strong>Use the auxiliary verb ""to be""</strong>
<strong> </strong>
<strong>Accepting or rejecting invitations in a polite manner</strong>
<p>
</p><hr><p><strong><span>1. Forming the Present Continuous Tense (with the verb ""having"")</span>
</strong></p>
<p>In lesson 6 we introduced the present continuous tense. We use this tense to describe something that is, or isn't, happening right now.</p>
<p>For example: ""I am <em>studying </em>English.""</p>
<p>An important verb that can be used to make many present continuous sentences is the verb ""to have,"" which is ""having"" in the present continuous form. We can use having with many nouns to make present continuous sentences.</p>
<p>[subject] + [""be""] + [""having""] + [object/complement]</p>
<p>In the dialogue, Daniel says ""I'm having a housewarming party tomorrow evening.""</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I am <em>having </em>a nap.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He is <em>having </em>an English test.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She is <em>having </em>a baby.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He is <em>having </em>a good time.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She isn't <em>having </em>a drink now.""</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm not <em>having </em>fun.""</li>
</ol><p>Often, <em>having</em> is used in place of the verbs ""<em>eating</em>"" and ""<em>drinking</em>."" This sounds very natural and casual.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm <em>having </em>lunch"" = I'm <em>eating </em>lunch</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""He's <em>having </em>a beer"" = He's <em>drinking </em>beer</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""She isn't <em>having </em>breakfast"" = She isn't <em>eating </em>breakfast.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I'm not <em>having </em>coffee"" = I'm not <em>drinking </em>coffee.</li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>2. Using the Auxiliary Verb ""to be""</span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auxiliary verbs are sometimes called ""helping verbs"" as they add meaning or functionality to other verbs. They are used to make questions, the passive form, exclamations and to help with the different verb tenses.</p>
<p>The main auxiliary verbs are ""be,"" ""have"" and ""do.""</p>
<p><strong>The auxiliary verb ""to be""</strong></p>
<p>First, let's look at how ""be"" conjugates. It is different depending on who the subject of the sentence is.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong><span>3. Accepting or Rejecting Invitations in a Polite Manner</span>
</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's very likely that you will receive invitations from friends or colleagues to go out, eat a meal, see a film together, or many other activities. You may even be invited to more formal occasions, such as a wedding.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When it is an informal invitation between friends, you can respond in many informal ways, but with these formal invitations, you should also reply in a formal and polite way.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Whether you are accepting or rejecting, it is polite to first thank the person with a phrase such as ""Thank you for inviting me.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To accept, you can use phrases such as:</p>
<ol><li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">""Thank you for inviting me, I would love to come.""</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">""Thanks for the invite, I'm looking forward to it.""</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">""Thanks for the kind invite, I'd be honoured to come.""</p>
</li>
</ol><p dir=""ltr"">When rejecting an invitation, sometimes an explanation as to why you are rejecting is needed. When you give a reason, be polite! It is not polite to say that you don't want to, even if that is the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To reject an invitation you can use phrases such as:</p>
<ol><li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">""Thank you for inviting me, but I'm sorry that I can't attend.""</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">""Thanks for the invite, but I am busy that evening.""</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">""Thanks for the kind invite, but I already have other plans.""</p>
</li>
</ol><p dir=""ltr"">Saying that you are busy is a safe way to reject an invitation.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although people tend to buy their own houses and settle into a home for several years, moving house is still something that happens quite frequently. It can be a very stressful time if buying a house, as the sale can fall apart quite easily, especially if you're in a chain and are relying on other people to move out before you can move in. After moving house, it is polite to introduce yourself to your neighbours. This isn't a formal meeting and you don't need to buy gifts like in some other countries and cultures. In recent times, people generally just go to their next-door neighbours' houses or even just wait until they see them in the street. An easy way to greet the neighbours is to invite them to a housewarming party. You don't have to invite the neighbours and could just invite your own existing friends, but if you're going to have a party shortly after moving it, it's polite to warn your neighbours first!</p>
