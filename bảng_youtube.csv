  What type of membership will he choose?
  Let me start by explaining our club's different membership options, as described in this brochure. Regular members can use the gym and the pool at any time on any day of the week. But we also offer early-morning memberships where people can use the facilities only in the early morning, and night memberships for people who only want to come in the evening.
  What are the hours for early-morning members?
  Early-morning members can use the facilities from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., and night members can use them from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.
  I see, so early-morning members can stop by and use the facilities on their way to work.
  Exactly. The early-morning type is popular among people with 9-to-5 jobs. And we also offer memberships just for the gym or just for the pool if you only want to use one of those.
  I want to use both the gym and the pool. I think I'll use the gym in the early morning before going to work on weekdays, and then use the pool on the weekend. Do you have a membership that covers something like early-mornings for the weekdays, but all day on the weekend?

  Well...we'd like to give you three design options for the initial draft, and then have you choose the one which best fits your concept. Then, we'll make the final design based on your choice. So it'd be very helpful if you could give us two more weeks to prepare for this stage.

  Okay, let's check the Internet.
  The Ocean Hotel is near the beach. It says 120 dollars a night per person. And you get a buffet breakfast.
  How about the Pine Hotel. It's 80 dollars a night. I don't want to waste too much on accommodations.
  Hmm... But the Pine Hotel is far from the beach and from downtown. And it says you have to pay for Wi-Fi.
  What about the Sunrise Hotel? It usually costs 140 dollars a night, but now they're running a promotion and we can stay one night for 90 dollars.
  It's between the beach and downtown. Plus it has free Wi-Fi!
  Sounds good! Oh, wait. It says the deal is for next week only...
  Oh, I didn't see that.
  So, how about this place, the Royal Hotel? It's located in the middle of downtown, and it costs 100 dollars a night. The room doesn't look so nice, but they have free Wi-Fi.
  Ok, let's book this hotel... Oh, it's already fully booked.
  Shoot. Then I think the first one is best. Is it full?
  No, it's not. Great!"

  How are they going to arrange the tables?
  Let's move the tables for tomorrow's meeting.
  Alright, shall we put all the tables in the center of the room, so that everyone faces each other?
  Well, there's going to be a group session first, so let's separate the tables into four sections. Four people will be seated in each group.
  Okay, and I'll put some pens and pads of paper on each table.
  Thank you. And we'll have a short presentation at the beginning of the session, so we need a projector here.
  All right. Also, we're going to use a whiteboard, aren't we? Is it okay if I put the whiteboard next to the screen?
  Well, how about putting the whiteboard at the other end of the room?
  That makes sense.
  After the meeting, we need to put everything back where it was — in four rows of two tables per row.

  What will the man order?
  Every month, you need to check our office supplies and order any items that are running low. This time, let's take a look at them together. Here's the checklist.
  Ok, that sounds good. Well, starting with the paper, it looks like there's only one box left.
  We use lots of paper every day, so let's order two more boxes.
  Okay. The printer is out of color ink. Should we order that?
  We don't really print documents in color, so we don't need to worry about that.
  Hmm... Okay. Looks like these whiteboard markers are running out of ink.
  Right. Those need to be replaced. We get a discount if we order them in sets of five, so let's do that.
  Okay. Oh, and while we're at it, can we order a mouse? Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't.
  That's probably because it's running out of batteries. Let's check the stock of batteries, and order more if we don't have many left.
  Sure. Well... We have three batteries here.
  You can take two of these for your mouse, but buy a six-pack of batteries to replace them."

  How is she going to get to the airport?
  Excuse me, I need to go to the airport. Would you tell me how to get there?
  Sure, there are a few ways... If you take Bus #1 it takes about one and a half hours to the airport. It's the least expensive way.
  Bus #2 is a non-stop bus. It's more expensive and leaves once every hour, but it only takes 50 minutes.
  I see. What about taxis?
  There's a taxi stand in front of the building, and they take about an hour.
  But they use the expressway and charge extra for a lot of luggage, so it's going to be a lot more expensive than the bus.
  I guess that makes sense, and I'd like to avoid paying too much.
  You didn't, by chance, buy anything at Shopping World while you were here?
  They offer complimentary shuttle service to the airport for customers who make a purchase there.
  Wow, I didn't know that! I haven't bought anything yet, but I was going to stop by and get some souvenirs there anyway.
  Then you can use that!"

  What is the woman going to get for the sale?
  I need you to deliver some more sweaters in time for the sale next month.
  Okay, what do you need?
  We need 1000 of the small red sweaters and 400 of the medium red sweaters.
  And we also need 600 of the small green sweaters and 200 of the medium green sweaters by the end of this month.
  Red and green sweaters... Actually, we're running low on green sweaters, and we're waiting on some green yarn from our supplier. We'll get you started with the red sweaters, though.
  No, no, no. We need the red and green sweaters together. So please just get as many green sweaters ready as you can.
  Okay... I think we can get 200 of the green sweaters to you on time. Which size has higher priority?
  The small ones take priority. Sorry for such short notice, but we really need your help.
  All right, we'll do our best. We'll get those green sweaters to you along with all the red sweaters you ordered."
