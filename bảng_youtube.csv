  Which book does the woman want to see?<br />
  Excuse me. I&#8217;d like to take a look at a book on that shelf.<br />

  The one about cars.<br />
  One moment, please. (pause) This one?<br />
  Yeah, that&#8217;s right.<br />
  Here you go.</p>"

  What&#8217;s the man going to order?<br />
  What are you going to order?<br />
  The pizza looks delicious. I think I&#8217;ll go with that.<br />
  I had pizza yesterday. So&#8230;<br />
  Ok, then, what about the hamburger?<br />
  Sounds good. I&#8217;ll go with that.

  I&#8217;ll finish at 2 o&#8217;clock.<br />

  Which shirt is he going to buy?<br />
  Hmm&#8230; Which shirt do you think is better? The white one, or the blue one?<br />
  Well, I think the blue one is better. It goes well with this gray jacket.<br />
  You think so? But it doesn&#8217;t go so well with this red tie, does it?<br />
  Well, that&#8217;s true.<br />
  Okay, then I&#8217;ll take the white one, not the blue one.</p>"

  Which necklace is he going to buy?<br />
  May I help you?<br />
  I&#8217;m looking for a birthday present for my wife. What do you recommend?<br />
  Well, what about this necklace?<br />
  Hmm, it looks a little long.<br />
  What about these over here? We have one with a flower pendant, and another one with a heart.<br />
  I&#8217;m looking for something a bit more sophisticated. How much is this pearl necklace over here?<br />
  It&#8217;s 5,000 dollars.<br />
  Hmm, that&#8217;s too expensive. Okay, I&#8217;ll take the first one.<br />
  Sure thing. Here you are.</p>"

  Where is the old printer?<br />
  Where should we put the new printer?<br />
  Hmm, I think we should put it where the old printer is now.<br />
  But the old one still works. We&#8217;re going to keep using it.<br />
  Ok, so we can&#8217;t put the new one there.<br />
  It&#8217;s too bad. It would be nice to have the new one on the bookshelf next to the door, but there&#8217;s only room for one printer there.<br />
  Okay, then, I think we should put it on the other side of the room.<br />
  Right. How about next to the window?<br />
  That sounds good.</p>"

  What&#8217;s he going to buy?<br />
  Hey, heading home now.<br />
  Okay. Could you buy something on the way home?<br />
  Sure. What do you want me to get?<br />
  We need some milk and bread for tomorrow&#8217;s breakfast.<br />
  Milk and bread. Got it. How many cartons of milk?<br />
  One should be fine.<br />
  Okay. Anything else?<br />
  One second. Let me check if we have butter. [pause] Ok, we&#8217;ve got some.<br />
  Alright. Do we have any beer left?<br />
  Yes, we still have a bottle here.<br />
  Okay, so we don&#8217;t need to buy any right now.<br />
  Right, I think we&#8217;re good. Thank you!</p>"

  What&#8217;s the forecast?<br />
  We&#8217;ll have sunny weather all through the morning. In the afternoon, though, it&#8217;s going to get cloudy, and we&#8217;ll have rain in the night. The rain will continue through the night until early tomorrow morning, when the sun will start coming out again.</p>"

  Which design did they decide on?<br />
  We&#8217;ve got some new designs for the company business card. Which one do you think is best?<br />
  Let&#8217;s see&#8230;. I think the company name should be bigger.<br />
  Ok, then it should be one of these.<br />
  Right. I like these because the company name is big and on top.<br />
  One of these has a space for a photo. What do you think?<br />
  Hmm. I think it makes the text a little too small.<br />
  Yeah, the text could be a little hard to read with the picture.<br />
  Okay, then, let&#8217;s go with the other one.</p>"

  Where is the bus stop?<br />
  Excuse me, do you know if there&#8217;s a bus stop near here?<br />
  Yes, one is very close. First go straight and turn at the second traffic light.<br />
  Then turn left at the corner of the bookstore you will see a bank. The bus stop is in front of the bank.<br />
  Got it. Thank you so much!</p>"

  Hmm. Michael doesn&#8217;t drink coffee. Do we have any bottled water?<br />

  Excellent. Very good.<br />
  Do you want anything?<br />

  Okay, how about this one? It&#8217;s really flat and light.<br />
  It looks nice. Can you watch DVDs on this computer?<br />
  I&#8217;m afraid not. You can watch DVDs on that one, but it&#8217;s a little bit larger and heavier.<br />
  Hmm, yeah. This is too heavy. I&#8217;ll buy the first one.<br />
  Thank you so much. You can choose from white, black, or silver.<br />
  I want the black one.</p>"

  Hmm, I like a big living room, but I want a parking space.<br />
  Let&#8217;s see&#8230; how about this one?<br />
  Yeah, that&#8217;s nice! Should we go see this one?<br />
  Wait a second. Isn&#8217;t the closet a bit too small?<br />
  Good point. Hmm, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be one that&#8217;s perfect&#8230; Wait, how about this one?<br />
  It&#8217;s got everything we need, doesn&#8217;t it? And the closet is pretty large, too. Let&#8217;s go see this one!<br />

  Hi, I&#8217;d like to stay for one night on September 22nd.<br />
  Certainly. One night from September 22nd. How many people?<br />
  Two.<br />
  Would you like a smoking or a non-smoking room, sir?<br />
  Non-smoking.<br />
  The only non-smoking room available on that day is a mountain view room. Is that okay?<br />
  Well, I was hoping for an ocean view room..<br />
  I&#8217;m sorry, but the only ocean view room available on that day is a smoking room.<br />
  I see&#8230; Is there a non-smoking, ocean view room available on September 23rd?<br />
  Yes, there is!<br />
  Okay, we&#8217;ll stay on September 23rd.</p>"

  Ah yes, welcome Ms. Richie. Please come this way. What can I do for you today?<br />
  I&#8217;d like to change my hair style a little bit.<br />
  Okay, what length would you like?<br />
  About shoulder length.<br />
  Alright, and what about your bangs?<br />
  Keep the bangs.<br />
  Straight down or parted on the side?<br />
  To the side a bit.<br />
  Which side?<br />
  Maybe a little left from the middle.<br />
  Got it! We&#8217;ll start with a shampoo, so please come this way.</p>"

  Which job is the female student going to apply for?<br />
  Hey, what do you think about this job? The hourly pay is pretty high.<br />
  Sure, the pay looks great, but could you really do a newspaper delivery route?<br />
  Of course! I&#8217;m good at riding bikes. But I&#8217;m worried about waking up early&#8230;<br />
  What about this one? The pay isn&#8217;t as high, but you can work 2 or 3 days a week and start working from the evening.<br />
  Oh, this one? A supermarket cashier, huh? Well, it would be good to work after school.<br />
  This one for a coffee shop might be good, too.<br />
  Oh yeah, I love that place! And it&#8217;s on my way to school.<br />
  Not bad, huh?<br />
  Hmm&#8230; which one should I apply to?<br />
  Which two is it between? The coffee shop and the newspaper delivery route?<br />
  Yeah, the pay for the newspaper route is really nice. &#8230;Okay! My mind&#8217;s made up! I guess I&#8217;ll just have to get up early.</p>"

  Which dress is she going to buy?<br />
  It looks very nice on you. And it fits perfectly.<br />
  Yeah, it fits&#8230; but I usually wear plain colors. I&#8217;m not used to this kind of a pattern.<br />
  Well, I think you look great.<br />
  Yeah? Still, it would take some courage for me to actually wear this&#8230;<br />
  What about this dress, then? The pattern is much more reserved so it won&#8217;t feel as flashy.<br />
  You&#8217;re right, let me try that one on.<br />
  Go right ahead. (pause) What do you think, ma&#8217;am?<br />
  This one suits me much more than the last. Do you have a long-sleeved version with this design?<br />
  Yes, we do.<br />
  Thanks, I&#8217;ll buy that!</p>"

  Hey, could you do me a favor? There&#8217;s a document on my desk, and I need you to deliver it to the sales department.<br />
  Sure, which one is it?<br />
  I think it&#8217;s in a blue envelope.<br />
  A blue envelope&#8230;. Well, there are two blue envelopes on your desk.<br />
  Ah right, there should be a red stamp in the upper right corner of the envelope. The other one should have a green stamp, but it&#8217;s the orientation guide we hand out to new employees.<br />
  The one with the red stamp&#8230; Okay, got it.<br />
  Great. Please deliver it to the sales departement by 1&#8217;00. And make sure you give it to the manager directly. You know him, right?<br />
  Yes, we&#8217;ve met several times.<br />
  Good. And while you&#8217;re at it, could you deliver the other envelope to HR?<br />
  Sure thing.</p>"

  Hello. How can I help you?<br />
  Hi&#8230; I was at your restaurant for lunch today, and I think I left my scarf there.<br />
  You left your scarf at the table? Do you remember where you were seated?<br />
  Well&#8230; it was in the back of the restaurant.<br />
  Were you in the smoking area or the non-smoking area?<br />
  The non-smoking area.<br />

  Which apartment is he probably going to choose?<br />
  Hi there, I&#8217;m looking for an apartment. Could you show me some floor plans?<br />
  Sure thing. Will you be living alone?<br />
  No, I&#8217;m married, and we&#8217;re looking for a one-bedroom apartment with a study.<br />
  Okay, how about this one? There are two rooms plus a living room. It&#8217;s near a busy street, though, so it might not be very quiet.<br />
  I see. I usually work at home, so I need a quiet place. And I&#8217;d prefer the living room to be square shaped.<br />
  Well, how about this one? It&#8217;s located a bit far from downtown, but it&#8217;s in a quiet residential area. There are two rooms and a living room, but one of the rooms is a little small.<br />
  Hmmm&#8230; We don&#8217;t have too much stuff, so this one might work for us.<br />
  We can show you another apartment with bigger rooms, but it&#8217;s located further from downtown.<br />
  No, thank you. Let&#8217;s have a look at the second one you showed me.</p>"

  Excuse me, I&#8217;d like to order a birthday cake for my daughter.<br />
  Great! Could you tell me what kind of cake you&#8217;re looking for?<br />
  My daughter likes chocolate, so I think a chocolate cream cake would be good. And can you put strawberries on it?<br />
  Absolutely. We have round and square cakes. Which one would you prefer?<br />
  Hmmm&#8230; A round one, please.<br />
  Okay. How old is your daughter going to be?<br />
  She&#8217;ll be twelve.<br />
  Okay, then we&#8217;ll get twelve candles ready. Do you want to write a message?<br />
  Yes, please write, &#8220;Happy Birthday.&#8221;<br />
  Alright, and do you want that written in pink? If so, we&#8217;ll put it on a white plate. Otherwise, we can write it in white, and put it on a pink plate.<br />
  Please write it in pink and put it on a white plate.</p>"

  When are they going to move?<br />
  I think we should decide on the moving date and call a moving company.<br />
  Sounds good. I was just looking at some moving companies.<br />
  I don&#8217;t want to pay a lot of money.<br />
  Definitely. This company here will give us a discount of 10 percent if we book at least one month before the moving day.<br />
  One month before? Then we have to move after December 15th in order to get the discount.<br />
  Yep. And there&#8217;s an additional discount if we book on a weekday.<br />
  A weekday? Well, I have a meeting that Monday mornning, and the exhibition is on Tuesday and Wednesday, so&#8230;<br />
  Friday would be good because we could then organize the new place over the weekend.<br />
  Yeah&#8230; but wait a second. They say &#8220;15 percent off Monday to Thursday and 5 percent off on Friday.&#8221;<br />
  Well, what do you want to do?<br />
  Let&#8217;s go for the biggest discount. I&#8217;ll be done with the exhibition by then, anyway.</p>"

  Which <span class=""caps"">TWO</span> charts is he using for his presentation?<br />
  Please look at the handout. The left chart shows our company&#8217;s sales over the past three years and the sales forecast for the current year. And the right chart shows the monthly breakdown in sales up to October of this year.<br />
  Now, please have a look at the left chart. It shows that sales have been steadily increasing over the past three years. And if we can keep increasing our sales, the total sales for this year will show an increase over last year. Next, please look at the right chart. The right chart shows that the campaigns we ran in April and August were fairly effective.<br />
  I see, but the sales decreased in May and September following the campaigns.<br />
  Yes, but this kind of decrease is unavoidable. I expect the annual sales for this year will show an increase over last year if we can keep increasing our sales.</p>"

  What type of membership will he choose?<br />
  Let me start by explaining our club&#8217;s different membership options, as described in this brochure. Regular members can use the gym and the pool at any time on any day of the week. But we also offer early-morning memberships where people can use the facilities only in the early morning, and night memberships for people who only want to come in the evening.<br />
  What are the hours for early-morning members?<br />
  Early-morning members can use the facilities from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., and night members can use them from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.<br />
  I see, so early-morning members can stop by and use the facilities on their way to work.<br />
  Exactly. The early-morning type is popular among people with 9-to-5 jobs. And we also offer memberships just for the gym or just for the pool if you only want to use one of those.<br />
  I want to use both the gym and the pool. I think I&#8217;ll use the gym in the early morning before going to work on weekdays, and then use the pool on the weekend. Do you have a membership that covers something like early-mornings for the weekdays, but all day on the weekend?<br />
  We&#8217;re sorry but we don&#8217;t offer a membership like that, sir.<br />
  OK. I don&#8217;t think I can get up that early on the weekend, so I&#8217;ll choose this membership option.</p>"

  When is the deadline for the first design draft for the brochure?<br />
  We decided to launch the new product on October 15th, and we&#8217;d like to offer you the contract to make the brochure.<br />
  Thank you so much. We&#8217;re definitely excited about helping you with this project. So could you tell us a bit about the schedule? When will you need everything by?<br />
  Well, considering the time needed for printing, we&#8217;d like to get the brochures to the printing stage by the end of September. So would it be possible for you to get us the first design draft by the middle of August?<br />
  Well&#8230;we&#8217;d like to give you three design options for the initial draft, and then have you choose the one which best fits your concept. Then, we&#8217;ll make the final design based on your choice. So it&#8217;d be very helpful if you could give us two more weeks to prepare for this stage.<br />
  Hmm, okay. Maybe one month will be enough time to choose one of the designs you&#8217;ve made and then decide on the final design. Alright, we&#8217;ll be counting on you.<br />
  You&#8217;re in good hands. Our design team is the best. Thank you so much.</p>"

  Which two seats did she get?<br />
  Hello, this is Blackfriars Playhouse. Can I help you?<br />
  I&#8217;d like to get two tickets for &#8220;King Lear&#8221; at 5&#8217;30 this evening. Do you still have any tickets available?<br />
  We do have a few seats left, but I&#8217;m sorry to say we don&#8217;t have any next to each other. If you don&#8217;t mind, though, we can get you two seats separately.<br />
  OK, we don&#8217;t mind.<br />
  Do you have any particular requests?<br />
  Well&#8230;do you have any aisle seats?<br />
  Yes, we have an aisle seat at the left side of the center section. And to the right of it, three seats over, we have another free seat.<br />
  To the side? OK, then please book that aisle seat.<br />
  Certainly. How about the other one?<br />
  Do you have any seats near the center?<br />
  The only center seats we have left are from the first row to the third row.<br />
  I&#8217;m not too crazy about having actors spit on me, so&#8230;<br />
  This room is relatively small, and I think you could enjoy the play even at the end of the row on the side.<br />
  Is that so? Then I&#8217;ll take the one you mentioned before on the left side.</p>"

  What will the woman check after the conversation ends?<br />
  OK, I think we&#8217;re almost ready for the presentation tomorrow&#8230;just a few more things&#8230; The meeting will start at 9 sharp, so could you double-check the meeting room today?<br />
  Yep, I&#8217;ve already checked the room.<br />
  Ok, Great. Did you make sure the projector&#8217;s working okay?<br />
  Oh, I was going to check the projector tomorrow morning when I had my laptop.<br />
  No, we&#8217;ve got to get that checked today. We won&#8217;t have time to deal with it in the morning if there&#8217;s a problem. So make sure to check that projector today. That&#8217;s the most important thing, OK?<br />
  Will do.<br />
  And&#8230;did you get the copies of those handouts?<br />
  Ms. Tanaka is making them now.<br />
  Let&#8217;s see&#8230; what else&#8230;oh, did you check the whiteboard?<br />
  Yes I did.<br />
  Sometimes the pens don&#8217;t have enough ink left in them. Did you get a chance to check them?<br />
  Not yet, but I&#8217;ll make sure to do that later.<br />
  Yes, please make sure to do that today.</p>"

  Which hotel are they going to choose?<br />
  We have to decide on the hotel for our trip next month.<br />
  Okay, let&#8217;s check the Internet.<br />
  The Ocean Hotel is near the beach. It says 120 dollars a night per person. And you get a buffet breakfast.<br />
  How about the Pine Hotel. It&#8217;s 80 dollars a night. I don&#8217;t want to waste too much on accommodations.<br />
  Hmm&#8230; But the Pine Hotel is far from the beach and from downtown. And it says you have to pay for Wi-Fi.<br />
  What about the Sunrise Hotel? It usually costs 140 dollars a night, but now they&#8217;re running a promotion and we can stay one night for 90 dollars.<br />
  It&#8217;s between the beach and downtown. Plus it has free Wi-Fi!<br />
  Sounds good! Oh, wait. It says the deal is for next week only&#8230;<br />
  Oh, I didn&#8217;t see that.<br />
  So, how about this place, the Royal Hotel? It&#8217;s located in the middle of downtown, and it costs 100 dollars a night. The room doesn&#8217;t look so nice, but they have free Wi-Fi.<br />
  Ok, let&#8217;s book this hotel&#8230; Oh, it&#8217;s already fully booked.<br />
  Shoot. Then I think the first one is best. Is it full?<br />
  No, it&#8217;s not. Great!</p>"

  How are they going to arrange the tables?<br />
  Let&#8217;s move the tables for tomorrow&#8217;s meeting.<br />
  Alright, shall we put all the tables in the center of the room, so that everyone faces each other?<br />
  Well, there&#8217;s going to be a group session first, so let&#8217;s separate the tables into four sections. Four people will be seated in each group.<br />
  Okay, and I&#8217;ll put some pens and pads of paper on each table.<br />
  Thank you. And we&#8217;ll have a short presentation at the beginning of the session, so we need a projector here.<br />
  All right. Also, we&#8217;re going to use a whiteboard, aren&#8217;t we? Is it okay if I put the whiteboard next to the screen?<br />
  Well, how about putting the whiteboard at the other end of the room?<br />
  That makes sense.<br />
  After the meeting, we need to put everything back where it was — in four rows of two tables per row.</p>"

  What will the man order?<br />
  Every month, you need to check our office supplies and order any items that are running low. This time, let&#8217;s take a look at them together. Here&#8217;s the checklist.<br />
  Ok, that sounds good. Well, starting with the paper, it looks like there&#8217;s only one box left.<br />
  We use lots of paper every day, so let&#8217;s order two more boxes.<br />
  Okay. The printer is out of color ink. Should we order that?<br />
  We don&#8217;t really print documents in color, so we don&#8217;t need to worry about that.<br />
  Hmm&#8230; Okay. Looks like these whiteboard markers are running out of ink.<br />
  Right. Those need to be replaced. We get a discount if we order them in sets of five, so let&#8217;s do that.<br />
  Okay. Oh, and while we&#8217;re at it, can we order a mouse? Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.<br />
  That&#8217;s probably because it&#8217;s running out of batteries. Let&#8217;s check the stock of batteries, and order more if we don&#8217;t have many left.<br />
  Sure. Well&#8230; We have three batteries here.<br />
  You can take two of these for your mouse, but buy a six-pack of batteries to replace them.</p>"
4;39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_xM0rRkQr4&list=PL5bLw9Uguvv0Q6yEZUcNMs0uQDYpffIx4&index=10;"<p>A woman is asking for directions to the airport at an information center.<br />
  How is she going to get to the airport?<br />
  Excuse me, I need to go to the airport. Would you tell me how to get there?<br />
  Sure, there are a few ways&#8230; If you take Bus #1 it takes about one and a half hours to the airport. It&#8217;s the least expensive way.<br />
  Bus #2 is a non-stop bus. It&#8217;s more expensive and leaves once every hour, but it only takes 50 minutes.<br />
  I see. What about taxis?<br />
  There&#8217;s a taxi stand in front of the building, and they take about an hour.<br />
  But they use the expressway and charge extra for a lot of luggage, so it&#8217;s going to be a lot more expensive than the bus.<br />
  I guess that makes sense, and I&#8217;d like to avoid paying too much.<br />
  You didn&#8217;t, by chance, buy anything at Shopping World while you were here?<br />
  They offer complimentary shuttle service to the airport for customers who make a purchase there.<br />
  Wow, I didn&#8217;t know that! I haven&#8217;t bought anything yet, but I was going to stop by and get some souvenirs there anyway.<br />
  Then you can use that!</p>"

  What is the woman going to get for the sale?<br />
  I need you to deliver some more sweaters in time for the sale next month.<br />
  Okay, what do you need?<br />
  We need 1000 of the small red sweaters and 400 of the medium red sweaters.<br />
  And we also need 600 of the small green sweaters and 200 of the medium green sweaters by the end of this month.<br />
  Red and green sweaters&#8230; Actually, we&#8217;re running low on green sweaters, and we&#8217;re waiting on some green yarn from our supplier. We&#8217;ll get you started with the red sweaters, though.<br />
  No, no, no. We need the red and green sweaters together. So please just get as many green sweaters ready as you can.<br />
  Okay&#8230; I think we can get 200 of the green sweaters to you on time. Which size has higher priority?<br />
  The small ones take priority. Sorry for such short notice, but we really need your help.<br />
  All right, we&#8217;ll do our best. We&#8217;ll get those green sweaters to you along with all the red sweaters you ordered.</p>"
